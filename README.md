# Capstone-Project-AVIATION-FLIGHT DELAY ANALYSIS
# ABOUT PROJECT
A flight delay is when an airline flight takes off and/or lands later than its scheduled time.

The United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) considers a flight to be delayed when it is 15 minutes later than its scheduled time. 

A cancellation occurs when the airline does not operate the flight at all for a certain reason.

In the United States, when flights are canceled or delayed, passengers may be entitled to compensation due to rules obeyed by every flight company, usually Rule 240, or Rule 218 in certain locations. 

This rule usually specifies that passengers may be entitled to certain reimbursements, including a free room if the next flight is the day after the canceled one, a choice of reimbursement, rerouting, phone calls, and refreshments.

The US Department of Transportation imposes a fine of up to US$27,500 per passenger for planes left on the tarmac for more than three hours without taking off or four hours for international flights.

However, passengers are not entitled to direct monetary compensation under US law when a delay occurs. Instead, airlines are merely required to pay for lodging costs of passengers if the delay or cancellation is their own fault, but not if the cause is beyond their control, such as weather.

# CONCLUTION
Late Aircraft Delay and Airline Delay/Air Carrier Delay are the biggest contributors are the reasons for Delay with Avg of 24 and 19 minutes.

Weather is the main reason for the cancellation with 48,851 flights.

It may not be possible to address all the delays and cancellations affecting Airlines and Passengers. But, the Delays which can be addressed are Carrier and National Airport System.

Steps taken to reduce Air Carrier and NAS may give the solutions to take care and minimize the other delay and cancellation of Flights.

Resulting in a compounded effect that will allow more efficient operations; benefiting passengers, airports, carriers and even the world as a whole.

If carriers allowed aircrafts a higher speed and fuel consumption on planes that departed late, the effect wouldn't spread along the flight chain. This would decrease the NAS Delay itself and the Late Aircraft Delay, decreasing significatively the number of planes delayed.
